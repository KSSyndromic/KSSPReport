#' Getting Nulls Summaries for Optional Fields
#'
#' This will generate percent and counts of null message, by facility. All are calculated on a once-per-visit basis (see `get_req_nulls`).
#' 
#' The distinctions between optional vs. invalid and per visit vs. every message were made based off of our interpretation of the
#' PHIN guide as well as the needs of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment Syndromic Surveillance.
#' 
#' @param data The raw data from BioSense on which you will do the null checks.
#' @return A summary data frame that lists counts and percentages for null fields, summarized at facility-level.
#' @import dplyr
#' @import tidyr
