#' Pulling Data
#'
#' This will pull down data from NSSP's BioSense Platform. It assumes you have a valid connection to BioSense_Platform log-in.
#' 
#' @param username Your BioSense username, as a string. This is the same username you may use to log into RStudio or Adminer.
#' @param password Your BioSense password, as a string. This is the same password you may use to log into RStudio or Adminer.
#' @param table The table that you want to retrieve the data from, as a string.
#' @param mft The MFT (master facilities table) from where the facility names will be retrieved, as a string.
#' @param start The start date time that you wish to begin pulling data from, as a string.
#' @param end The end data time that you wish to stop pulling data from, as a string.
#' @return A list of two data frames: first, raw data of all columns from the `table` that was called; second, just the Facility_Name
#' and C_Biosense_Facility_ID from the MFT table.
#' @import RODBC
